some helpful things for batocera

sleep_monitor is a service file. it doesn't function as intended. this was my original attempt to get sleep working

osd-controls.sh is to give volume and brightness controls. the osd doesn't function as intended. the volume isn't needed while inside emulationstation

lid-switch.sh is the currently functioning sleep when detecting the lid closure

multimedia_keys.conf is to trigger the brightness keys and lid switch and whatever else. volume not configured since this works correctly inside emulation station
